Getting Started:

Start with being a hero and fighting for the dark lord.
Hero has a randomized stamina that allows for # of rolls per turn.
Hero bets health to luckily attack the Boss' health.
Bet increments stem from 1x, 3x, and 10x of health.
Once stamina is depleted of the Hero, the turn switches to the boss where the computer will play.
If Boss hits 0, a new boss profile (randomized selection) will appear.
If Hero hits 0, game over will occur and Hero will be brought back to start to Fight for the Dark Lord.


Next Steps:
